This repo contains both the code for Frontend and Backend. 

The frontend was created using React, while the backend was made using Nodejs/Express as directed by the requirements.

Below described steps to locally set-up this project, for development/testing purposes.

Setting up Frontend:
1. After creating a clone of the repo, CD into leno-frontend.
2. Execute the command "npm install" to download all the package dependencies.
3. After the npm modules are installed, you can open a powershell instance and execute the command "npm start" to launch your frontend.

Setting up Backend:
1. After creating a clone of the repo, CD into backend.
2. Execute the command "npm install" to download all the package dependencies.
3. After the npm modules are installed, you can open a powershell instance and execute the command "node index.js" to launch your backend.

Makesure that your backend is running on "https://localhost:3000" as this is hardcoded as the API to fetech the product information in the frontend. Your frontend can run on any other port aside from this one.

PS: If you launch your frontend after making sure that your backend is up, node will automatically ask you to switch to a differnt port.
